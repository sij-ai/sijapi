# 〄 — on currents & into weeds

Clipped from [https://sij.law/](https://sij.law/) on Aug 05, 2024 at 10:22
Hey folks, welcome to my blogs sij.law and sij.ai!

## Introductions

You likely already know me if you’re reading this, but in case these blogs reach new readers, please forgive a brief introduction. I’m Sangye Ince-Johannsen. I'm a staff attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, where for five years I've litigated environmental cases in federal court on behalf of various local, regional, and national, and international conservation-oriented nonprofit organizations. My docket largely focuses on defending spotted owls, anadromous fish, grizzlies, wolves, and their respective habitats from federal and federally-licensed activities in cases brought under the Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Administrative Procedure Act, and Clean Water Act.

Before pursuing my legal career, I worked as a documentary filmmaker and videographer for four years in southern Oregon. During that time I had the privilege of working on several feature films including Robert Redford and Eve Ensler’s documentary *One Billion Rising* (2013), Leslie Griffith’s documentary *When Giants Fall* (2015), and a series of videos for the Neighborhood Food Project and other regional nonprofits. I also assisted on the production of several narrative films including *Redwood Highway* (2013) and *Wild* (2014), and produced a number of music and event videos.

Going back even further, before my undergraduate studies in Anthropology, Videography, and International Relations at Southern Oregon University, my first interest—my first love, even—was computer science and programming. After a long hiatus, my passion for programming, especially AI/ML research and development, has been rekindled. Recent advancements in AI have me particularly excited about leveraging large language models and automatic speech recognition to become a more productive and effective advocate.

## Vision for this blog

That’s what I hope to do with these blogs: share AI/ML scripts, workflows, and apps, along with key caveats and considerations, with other litigators and knowledge workers. I also intend to share some legal analysis and other fun stuff—AI image and speech generation, drone videography, self-hosting tools and tricks—along the way.

Come for the legal analysis, stay for AI art workflows? Or vice versa?

So, what’s with the two URLs, you may be wondering? For most of my posts, especially at the outset, you’ll get the same content whether you visit sij.law or sij.ai. However, if you’re a litigator and not necessarily an AI/ML enthusiast, there will likely be posts that aren’t interesting to you in the slightest, which I’ll save for sij.ai. If you’re passionate about AI/ML productivity hacks but not necessarily a litigator or interested in deep legal analysis, you’ll likely have a better time over on sij.ai. 

Either way, thanks for dropping by, feel free to explore some of my current projects in the site navigation, and I can’t wait to engage with you in the comments or on social media.

Cheers!
