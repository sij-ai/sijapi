This is designed to work with UserScripts and similar browser extensions. Fill in the domain/URL where your sijapi instance is exposed (http://localhost:4444 is fine for the same device, but consider using a reverse proxy to extend to your mobile devices).

And fill in your GLOBAL_API_KEY that you chose when configuring sijapi.
